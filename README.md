# GodotWildJam64
**TESTING BRANCH**

Here we can absolutely fffUCk our game up but still have the functional main branch
commit to your hearts delite, im on EST so have at it, whatever that means to you. 

I have an emty template for everyone to try out so we can build in a uniform structure to avoid "the black cat situation" from last jam.

#/this just is a personal note, im using all this silesystem stuff later for other projects. 
A group submission to the Godot Wild Jam 64! We hope you find some cool features in our code and use them in yours!

To the Players: [insert games desription, controls, need-to-knows, and credits with prefered titles and links to everyones portfolios so we can all get jobs]

to the devs: Please keep all changes and additions you make on your personal branches, and anything you want to add, please commit to the TESTING branch and let everyone know on the server so we don't break the final product.

to other devs: We hope you like our project and can find some cool code and artwork from our fantastic team and good luck with your projects!
